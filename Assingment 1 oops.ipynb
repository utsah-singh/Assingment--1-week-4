    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 . Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It allows you to control the access to the internal state of an object and ensures that data is accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces (methods). Encapsulation helps in data hiding and reduces the risk of unintended interference with an object's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 . Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, classes and objects allow you to abstract real-world entities by modeling their essential characteristics and behaviors. Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and focuses on the essential features, making it easier to understand and work with the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 . Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. Inheritance enables you to create a hierarchy of classes where each subclass inherits attributes and methods from its superclass and can also add or modify its own features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 . Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function in a way that is specific to their individual types. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a unified way. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding (in the case of inheritance) and through interfaces or abstract classes in some OOP languages. This feature enhances code flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars are fundamental principles in OOP, and they help in creating code that is more modular, maintainable, and flexible by promoting concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, code reuse, and polymorphic behavior."
